  <p>
    The auto repair service website project aimed to establish a strong online
    presence for a garage in Orange City, Florida. The goal was to create a
    user-friendly and responsive website that provided essential information about
    services, testimonials, and easy contact options. Through user research, UX
    design, responsive development, and iterative testing, a visually appealing
    and accessible website was created to cater to the needs of local residents
    and businesses seeking reliable auto repair services.

      <h3 class="fs-5">The Problem:</h3>
      <p> 
        Auto Repair Service Garage lacks an online 
        presence, resulting in difficulties for potential 
        customers to locate their services and obtain 
        comprehensive information about their offerings. 
        This absence of an online platform hinders trust building and limits
        communication channels,ultimately hindering the garage's ability to attract 
        and serve customers effectively.
