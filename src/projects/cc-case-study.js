<h2>Auto Repairing Garage</h2>
<h4>Website Design and Digital Marketing</h4>
<p>
  The auto repair service website project aimed to establish a strong online
  presence for a garage in Orange City, Florida. The goal was to create a
  user-friendly and responsive website that provided essential information about
  services, testimonials, and easy contact options. Through user research, UX
  design, responsive development, and iterative testing, a visually appealing
  and accessible website was created to cater to the needs of local residents
  and businesses seeking reliable auto repair services.
